# Network Analysis of the 3D Genome 

This repo contains the source code for my master project. 

A pipeline was made to process raw Hi-C data to networks. Hi-C data from five different tissues at resolutions ranging from 20kb - 1Mb were processed, both intra- and interchromosomal networks were made. The breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was compared to the benign cell line MCF-10A further, using centrality metrics, differnetial community detection and compartment analysis methods. 


Large-scale differences in chromatin topology were found between the benign and malignant cell line, especially on small chromosomes where MCF-7 had a larger degree of nodes in compartment A.

The thesis in full can be found in full [here](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/105389?show=full).
