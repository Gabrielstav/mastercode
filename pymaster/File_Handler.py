# Place to read in files from custom dir, containing all HiC-Pro output files
# This code will read in all these files, split them on Celline/Chromosome and resolution, and store this information.
# Files will be handed 1 by 1 to the Pipeline, which after its run will create two directories,
# one containing the edge list for that specific cell line/chromosome and resolution, and one containing the
# output from pipeline for each step like BEDPE, NCHG out etc

# We need to wrap the NCHG script, and include the Gtrack and FDR script in the code or wrap them as well.

# Look at diagram for dir structure.
