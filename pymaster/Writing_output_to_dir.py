"""
Writing pre-processed output edge lists to new files in specified directory
"""

# ALL file writing, reading and pathing should be done in a separate class called FileHandler or something like that,
# however this is lower pri rn

import os

# Not that important now, but nice to make when there is time.
# In the future, make is so that you can just specify the path to the parent dir,
# and this code just creates a new dir in that location automatically containing one file for each cell line
# with the corresponding pre-processed edge lists. 

# Use to OS module to check what directory we are in, read the files put in a specific directory (to be pre-processed),
# checks their format (only .gtrack compatibility as of now) and then run the pre-processing parts of the code,
# and outputs pre-processed files in the edge list format to a specific directory with specific file names,
# maybe just the original file names with "processed" or "edge-list" behind the name.


# Pseudocode-function to automatically process files and write to a new dir if we provide the dir:
# count = 0
# directory = "/Users/GBS/Master/HiC-Data/Processed_Data/HiC_from_Jonas/FullGenome"
# for filename in os.listdir(directory):
#     if filename.endswith(".txt"):
#         count += 1
#         with open(directory + filename, "r") as read_file:
#            return_of_your_function = do_something_with_data() # Putt pre-processinga over inn en funksjon som calles her
#         with open(directory + count + filename, "w") as write_file:
#             write_file.write(return_of_your_function)  !!! igjen bare caller funksjonen her !!!

# Selecting full genome and writing edge list to new file
# with open("/Users/GBS/Master/HiC-Data/Processed_Data/HiC_from_Jonas/FullGenome/TESTING", "w") as fp:
#     for node in nodes:
#         for edge in node.edges:
#             fp.write((node.id + " " + edge + "\n"))


# Selecting specific chromsome and writing edge list to new file
# with open("/Users/GBS/Master/HiC-Data/Processed_Data/Processed_J_data/HiC_from_Jonas/Chr18/IMR90_processed_chr18.txt", "w") as fp:
#     for l in nodes:
#         for edge in l.edges:
#              if l.chr == "chr18":  # Make a function that we can call to select id + edges from chromosome(s)?
#                  fp.write((l.id + " " + edge + "\n"))

# This outputs a file with the correct format but with header: id, edges (which should be removed).
# Use with open(file) that points to file opened earlier, should be able to find the path to the file opened when
# pre-processing the data, so that we only need to point to the full path once and the rest of the code knows what
# file(s) we are working with.
